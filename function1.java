/*Problem Statement
Sara is solving a math problem in which she has been given an integer N and her task is to find the number of operations required to convert N into 1.
Where in one operation you replace the number with its second-highest divisor.
Input
User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function DivisorProblem() that takes integer N as argument.

Constraints:-
1 <= N <= 100000
Output
Return the number of operations required.
Example
Sample Input:-
100

Sample Output:-
4
